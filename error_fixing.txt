# No Module Named Flask Error
    If vs code return no module named flask error, change the interpreter (if using windows, remember to run python instead of python3, causes same error)

# Syntax error can crash the web-server
    Rerun the web-server to fix the issue

# JINJA not finding html templates
    The template folder needed to be renamed to templates

# JINJA require tag-name
    When using a comment on html, having the {% %} in it caused the problem

# JINJA expected expression
    On login.html, the expression for the elif was missing

# Pylint accuses func.now() of not being callable
    False positive, can be ignored

# db.create_all() unexpected keyword argument 'app'
    SQLAlchemy no longer accepts an app argument to methods like create_all, instead it always requires an active flask application context.
    No need to create create database function, sqlalchemy will not overwrite an existing file and the only time the database wouldn't be created is if it raised an error.

# on auth.py db.session.add -> db is not defined
    from . import db

# 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'is_active'
    Changed 
    login_user(user, remember=False) on auth.py.sign_up()
                        to
    login_user(new_user, remember=False) on auth.py.sign_up()
